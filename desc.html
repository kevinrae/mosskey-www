<!--
      <p>A random-access, multiple entry key for the identification of the genera, and selected species, of North American mosses.   Based initially on <u>A Perspective Oriented Guide For the Identification of the North American Moss Genera</u> by Malcolm L. Sargent and Diane Lucas, 2006, et seq.  Transformated from the dichotomous format by Stephen P. Rae and David Hutton, 2015-2018.  Application development by Kevin Rae, 2016-2018.</p>

<p>While the key started as a revision to the <u>Perspective Oriented Guide</u> with its several amendments, the current authors (Stephen Rae and David Hutton) volunteered to revise the Guide by converting the content from dichotomous and trichotomous subkeys to a digital random-access, multiple-entry key on the web.  Along the way additional information was obtained from recent scientific publications, professional training curricula, and personal communications. While a reference to Flora North America is displayed for each taxon, a listing of all published and unpublished sources is not presented.</p>

<p>Note that there are entries for a genus such as <i>Grimmia</i>, and also for several species within that genus, such as <i>Grimmia alpicola</i>.  In some cases, only the genus is listed since additional information on its species has not yet been added to the dataset.  In many genera getting to the genus may not be difficult while going further to the species may require careful dissection and use of a light microscope.  After deciding on a species identification, bryologists often compare the specimen to a known, identified specimen in a herbarium.  Not everyone has ready access to a herbarium. But, having gotten somewhere in this key means reducing the packets sent off for ID, increasing confidence in identification skills, and saving time when looking for specialists and sending the packet off for identification. Referring to additional information recently published in <u>Flora North America</u>, volumes 27 and 28, provides opportunity to obtain pertinent additional descriptive text and frequent imagery.  And, of course, a Google search on the scientific name will lead to other informational sources and imagery.</p>

<h2>Goals and Strategy</h2>
<p>The <b>goals</b> of this Key are to create an identification system for the <b>intermediate level student</b> that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>gives <b>emphasis</b> to the <b>characters</b> frequently used in the identification of mosses.  It arranges the various character options into a multiple access scheme, rather than forcing everything into dichotomous states. The Key therefore not only functions in a practical way to allow identification of genera and species, but also acts as a <b>teaching tool</b> to quickly familiarize the user as to the important characters on which to focus.
  </li>
  <li>offers a multiple access structure for selecting observed characters. The user scrolls through characters grouped into logical sets, selecting those observed in the specimen. Characters may be selected in any order and are individually available.  That is, all characters are available on the same screen, the user is not required to successfully select a character in order to obtain a further set of selectable characters.
  </li>
  <li>provides <b>clarity</b> on the logical structure underlying the <b>total scheme</b>, i.e., the entire dataset is searchable on the main (Index) page. If a user realizes that an error in identification has been made, the questionable character can be deleted from the selected character list without losing the rest of the selections.
  </li>
  <li>searches the dataset to match genera and species to selected characters, reducing the number of potential matches as the number of selected characters increases. It minimizes the problems of a dichotomous key where a single wrong choice may not be discovered until the very end of the key; here a wrong choice usually involves deleting a selected character from the list. The aim is to minimize the problem that “keys are made by those that don’t need them, for those that can’t use them."
  </li>
  <li>is simple enough to allow the user to attempt identification based on whatever characters are easily observed on the specimen. The key interactively responds to tentative selections by offering matches while allowing that selection to be easily removed from consideration.
  </li>
  <li>provides a teaching minute by supporting the rapid cycling through of overlapping and slightly different variations of a character. The list of potential matches increase and decreases with changes in selected characters, encouraging the matching of characters with a known, previously identified specimen.
  </li>
  <li>Avoids user frustration due to lack of confidence in being sure of an observed character or absence of having to select an exact match of observation to character.  That is, the Key contains characters that may either overlap with another character of be a range of variability alongside other choices that represent components of that range.  That way, deciding on an approximate match of observation to character may eventually lead to an identification.  Selecting an approximate match in a dichotomous key typically leads to a mismatch and frustration.  And, is a negative learning experience.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>To the maximum extent possible, the <b>manner</b> in which characters are presented adheres to the following guidelines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>groups of similar characters are displayed <b>together</b> in alphabetical order. Variations within the groups are also in alphabetical order.
  </li>
  <li>the character line includes several words joined together in an increasing order of specificity.  The first word(s) describe a set of characters (such as “capsule”) while word(s) to the right focus in on a subset of capsule descriptions (such as “color” followed by “brown”.
  </li>
  <li>characters are annotated (by icon) as visible to the <b>naked eye</b>  <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-eye-open" aria-hidden="true" title="View by Eye"></span>, best observed through a <b>handlens</b>  <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-zoom-in" aria-hidden="true" title="View with Hand Lens"></span> (10x-20x) or can only be seen through the <b>microscope</b>  <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pawn" aria-hidden="true" title="View with Scope"></span>.  In the field, characters categorized as needing a microscope will not be observable. A dissecting microscope can be used to observe the handlens category, but a microscope with 100X or better power is required to view characters at the cellular level (indicated by a microscope icon).
  </li>
  <li>whenever possible, separating genera and species by choosing between only one microscope character has been avoided..
  </li>
  <li>please note that the characters chosen and the linking of those characters to genera and species in this Key is based on information gathered from several sources. Bryologists sometimes disagree on how to describe a species or the separation of part of a species to another species.  Different sources may also describe the same species with slight differences in character(s) or state that the character is variable. The Key provides overlapping characters to address those issues.
   </li>
</ul>

<h2>Genera Included & Nomenclature</h2>

<p>The genera included, and the nomenclature for them, are generally found in the Flora North America volumes (27 and 28) treating mosses. In certain groups and for several species there may be additional or different names included to reflect either later considerations on taxonomy and nomenclature.  And, newly described genera of species and mosses newly collected but known from other areas are included.</p>

<h2>Terminology</h2>

<p>That found in the glossaries of most major floras and, as an <b>optimum source</b>, the beautifully illustrated Mosses & Other Bryophytes; an Illustrated Glossary (Malcolm & Malcolm, 2000).</p>

<h2>Geographical Coverage & Distribution</h2>

<p>North America north of Mexico.  Of course, many of the mosses included in the Key occur in other parts of the world.</p>

<h2>Order of use and Character Limitations</h2>

<p>This Key is meant to be used <b>by selecting any character observed in the specimen that is included in the Key</b>. There is no required order in selecting characters. A random order of access applies. The Key may be described as a Random-Access Multiple-Entry identification tool.</p>

<p>However, characters linked to a genus are derived from characters applying to any species within the genus.  Not all species may express the character. Because to Key is a work-in-progress, a specific character may match to a genus but not to any species in that genus which is included in the Key.  As additional information is coded into the dataset this situation will decrease..</p>

<p><b>Cell Ratios</b> (length to breadth) ratios of medial, laminal leaf cells:
<p><b>Freely</b> branched (mostly pleurocarpous) mosses:
<p>Long cells: greater than <b>8:1</b>; commonly termed linear or linear-flexuose.
<p>Intermediate cells: <b>3-8:1</b>; commonly termed elongated, oblong-rhomboidal, fusiform, or elliptical.
<p>Short cells: less than <b>3:1</b>; commonly termed isodiametric, quadrate, rounded-quadrate, or rhombic.
<p><b>Rarely</b> branched (mostly acrocarpous) mosses:
<p>Long cells: greater than <b>5:1</b>; commonly termed linear.
<p>Intermediate cells: <b>2-5:1</b>; commonly termed elongated, rectangular, hexagonal, or rhomboidal.
<p>Short cells: less than <b>2:1</b>; commonly termed isodiametric, quadrate, rounded-quadrate, or sub-quadrate.

<h2>Cell surface ornamentation</h2>

<p>In the Key, a distinction is made between "Cells distinctly papillose or prorulose" and "Cells indistinctly ornamented."  <b>Distinct</b> ornamentation, e.g., papillose, prorulose, mammillose or bulging, is, in our view, ornamentation that is higher and can be seen with reasonable confidence when observing leaves in surface view.  <b>Indistinct</b> ornamentation, on the other hand, is lower and requires that observations be made on the bends of folded leaves or leaf cross-sections.</p>

<h2>Differences in treatment</h2>
<h2>Warnings</h2>

<p><b>Immature</b>, sterile or small, and ratty specimens often cannot be identified with certainty.  While many genera can be identified <b>in</b> the <b>field</b> with relative certainty, some can only be identified if sporophytes are present, and others cannot be identified with certainty in the field under any circumstances.</p>

<p><b>Substrate</b> specificity varies with conditions, i.e., with ideal conditions (often high humidity and moisture levels) taxa that might normally grow on bark may also be found on soil or rocks.</p>

<p>The characters used assume a “normal” level of <b>hydration</b>. Plants wet from a recent rain may look very different! For example, Hedwigia ciliata goes from being rigid and dull gray with tightly appressed leaves when dry, to soft and green with squarrose leaves when wet. Plants removed from their substrate may quickly alter their appearance. For example, leaves of Atrichum species will quickly fold up to the stem when the plants are removed from the soil.</p>

<p>The characters used assume a “typical” <b>size</b>. Plants growing under unusually adverse conditions, usually too dry, can be smaller than “typical”. Plants growing under unusually beneficial conditions, usually ideal moisture and humidity, can be larger than “typical”.</p>

<p><b>Color</b> can vary for a variety of reasons. Most mosses darken in color as they mature and age. Many mosses growing under lower light intensities will be green (shade form), whereas they will be reddish or purplish (sun form) from various pigments when growing under higher light intensities.</p>

<p>Remember that plants cannot read the book.  You will encounter variations in a character, sometimes on the same plant.</p>

<h2>Sources</h2>
<p>The <b>major</b> sources of information for this Key are:  the Key to Moss Genera of North America North of Mexico (Vitt & Buck, 1992); the floras for eastern North America (Crum & Anderson, 1981), the Pacific Northwest (Lawton, 1971), and North America (Grout, 1931-1940); the Pottiaceae treatment by Zander (1993); and the bryological treatments in Flora North America (volume 27 and 28). <b>Other</b> sources occasionally providing highly relevant information included the floras for Britain and Ireland (Smith, 1978), Japan (Noguchi, 1987-1994), Mexico (Sharp, Crum & Eckel 1994), the West Indies (Buck, 1998) and original articles in various bryological journals.</p>

<p>There has been a long <b>history</b> of efforts to make bryophyte identification easier for the non-specialist, and the works of Dunham (1916), Grout (1947), Bodenberg (1954), and Conard & Redfearn (1979) are good examples representing those efforts for North America. While the Sargent and Lucas (2006) work has benefited enormously from some ideas and concepts from these earlier works, the target audience is slightly different and the amount of information available has significantly increased.  This Key is meant not for the absolute novice, but for the <b>intermediate level naturalist</b> or bryologist having difficulties with specialist keys.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Perspective Guide by Sargent and Lucas was a word processing document migrated to the web, but not interactive.  Opportunities to transform the Guide into digital form available as an interactive application became feasible.  Thus this Key was born.</p>

<h2>Disclaimers</h2>
<p>This Key is:</p>
<ul>
  <li> a work “<b>in progress</b>”, i.e., very much like <b>open-source</b> software, and in need of improvement and revision. We continue to discover ways to improve it as we work with actual collections, and constructive comments and criticisms would be greatly <b>appreciated</b>.  The authors are by no means experts on the moss flora of North America, and the preparation of this Key has been, among other things, a learning experience meant to make the authors more familiar with the flora. Revisions and corrections will be <b>posted</b> in at appropriate intervals.
  </li>
  <li>going to be "<b>out of date</b>" is a fact of life.  The authors recognize the need to upgrade the Key by incorporating new information and responding to comments.  Meanwhile, the Key relies on reference to Flora North America volumes for detailed information on descriptions and distributions. Google searching is another avenue for information.
  </li>
  <li>meant for users with <b>access</b> to a hand-lens, a dissecting microscope, and, preferably, a compound microscope. It assumes that the user already has a basic understanding of the morphology and life cycle of mosses, and the terminology used to describe those items.
  </li>
  <li>best used together with reference specimens. The user can compare a tentative identification with a specimen identified by a competent bryologist.  Such comparisons may be made in herbaria or by requesting assistance from a bryologist.  The Key provides an entry into such a support system by helping the user to limit potential matches before requesting help.
  </li>
  <li>meant to be <b>used with</b>, and as an <b>aid to</b>, floras presently available whether they cover major areas of North America, specific regions, or individual states, i.e., it is not a "stand-alone" product. The floras have invaluable information including:
     <ul>
        <li>full morphological descriptions of the mosses;</li>
        <li>habitat and substrate preferences;</li>
        <li>geographic ranges; and</li>
        <li>most importantly – illustrations.</li>
     </ul>
  </li>
  <li>totally <b>artificial</b> in that no effort is made to group phylogenetically related taxa or to imply relative significance of characters.</p>
</ul>
