<p>The authors (Stephen Rae and David Hutton) were frustrated when using dichotomous keys to identify California mosses.  Historically, there were limited published resources available to identify local mosses. All were in dichotomous form.  Such  keys involve moving through a hierarchical series of two-choice questions to get to an end point.  A wrong answer at any point usually leads to misidentification. Stephen had developed a random-access, multiple entry punch card key to the genera of mosses in California in 1975. He had used a similar punch card key to Colorado mosses developed by William Weber and Patricia Nelson in 1972. Although the punch card keys were easier to use, they did not lead to species identification. Moving next to a species level key required a heavy commitment to field collecting, examination of herbarium specimens and exacting original research.  A critical mass of species level information had not yet been developed, additional species were still being described, and the taxonomy and nomenclature of known collections were more frequently being revised.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Daniel Norris  had developed a dichotomous key to California mosses as a step towards published a flora of California mosses. He distributed his key to anyone interested in mosses, requesting comments on corrections and additions.  Also, Dan facilitated training sessions using the key as a means of field testing it and training more bryologists.  Along the way he and Stephen discussed the feasibility of migrating his information into a digital format.  In 2002, he transferred all of his preliminary files on digitizing his key to Stephen and said “I just don’t have the time to keep working on this! You take it over.” His efforts resulted in many new collections and an increasing number of amateurs and professionals focusing on the bryophytes of California.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, James Shevock was transitioning from a focus on vascular plants to interest in mosses.  He approached Dan and suggested that they collaborate to complete his key and catalogue.  That joint effort resulted in publication of a key and catalogue for California mosses in 2004, and provided a basis for the Bill Malcolm and Nancy Malcolm publications (2006, 2009) of descriptions and imagery of selected California mosses .  But, there still was the issue of a random-access, multiple-entry key.  Dan and Stephen occasionally met to identify collections and discuss progress on such a key. In 2002, Dan suddenly gave all of his digital files on moss identification (including his laptop) to Stephen.  Stephen retired, returned to graduate school to complete his doctorate, and rekindled efforts on the key.</p>

<p>While gathering materials for a new effort in developing the key, Stephen was alerted to the 2006 Guide by Malcolm Sargent and Diane Lucas. While it was to genera for the entire North American continent, several species were included.  And there were versions to edit entries for regional focus.  Stephen contacted Malcolm and Diane and requested additional information and permission to revise the Guide for California.  Over several years Stephen contacted many bryologists to obtain California-specific taxonomic information, including discussions at the annual Jepson Herbarium bryological forays (SoBeFree).  At the 2015 foray Stephen joined with David Hutton in approaching Malcolm to formally request permission to transform his information in the Guide to digital format. Malcolm had expressed a long-term interest in a multiple-entry format but stated that such an effort had to be done by others.  With the concurrence of Malcolm and Diane in 2015, the digital conversion and augmentation of the Guide commenced.  Kevin Rae joined the development team in 2016 to advise on the digital conversion and soon assumed responsibility for design of a dataset and creation of the application to bring the information to the web.  A beta version of a dataset subset and web application was developed in March 2018.</p>

<p>Efforts to more fully populate the dataset followed. Over time, the key is expected to encompass all species of mosses known to occur in North America.  And, over time, links to descriptive information and imagery will be added.</p>

<p>The key is a work-in-progress, comments on improvements, corrections or revisions are encouraged.  In fact, comments are requested. Should you run into problems in using the key, difficulty in understanding the meaning of a character, or questions regarding nomenclature or taxonomy, please comment.  There will always be differences of opinion among bryologists as to taxonomy and nomenclature, but the key will attempt to include easy to understand and largely acceptable choices. A team of knowledgeable bryologists has been invited to periodically review the key to assist the authors to identify errors, ambiguities and opportunities for improvement.  Also, bryologists and others working on mosses are encouraged to provide additional species-specific information for incorporation into the key.</p>
